### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Leonardo a **product-minded iOS Developer**. 

During the last year I led two teams to create **two apps now available on App Store**: [Litt](https://apps.apple.com/app/litt/id1628751457) and [Dotillism](https://apps.apple.com/app/dotillism/id1611775193). The development of these apps allowed me to gain experience building real products that users are now enjoying.

Beside these two apps in which I contributed to the code along with other peers, I also developed many prototypes by myself to further learn iOS development. 

Most noticeably I created [Good Vibes](https://github.com/uevs/GoodVibes), an app that connects to a Vapor server hosted on Heroku via custom REST APIs. I also built [XKCD Reader](https://github.com/uevs/XKCD-Reader), an app that connects to the official APIs to fetch and display the comics. [Place ARound](https://github.com/uevs/ARound) is instead an AR app built to learn about ARkit and RealityKit. 

I'm also among the winners of the **WWDC22 Swift Challenge**.
