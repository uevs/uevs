### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Leonardo a **product-minded iOS Developer**. 

During the last year I led two teams to create **two apps now available on App Store**: [Sunlitt](https://apps.apple.com/app/litt/id1628751457) and [Dotillism](https://apps.apple.com/app/dotillism/id1611775193). The development of these apps allowed me to gain experience building real products that users are now enjoying.

I'm an Apple Developer Academy alumnus and I'm among the winners of the **WWDC22 Swift Challenge**.

Check out [SunKit](https://github.com/Sunlitt/SunKit), the open source Swift library we created for Sunlitt.
