### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Leonardo a **product manager** that is learning to **code**. 

I'm attending Apple Developer Academy @Unina where I'm learning iOS development with Swift. Before this experience I worked as a product manager for an **indie tabletop games studio**, developing games and launching them on Kickstarter raising more than **$1.4 million**. Prior to that, I worked as marketing manager for a couple of other startups.

Iâ€™m passionate about **photography** and I have a **degree in communications and media studies**. My background is geared more toward creativity, both with words and visual media. Even if my career shifted toward business and tech, I still bring to the table my creative background and inclination.

During the Academy, besides learning coding fundamentals, I was able to approach many interesting aspects of iOS development: [AR](https://github.com/uevs/ARound), [Swift on Server and Vapor](https://github.com/uevs/GoodVibes), and game development. At the Academy there is also a strong focus on improving soft skills, creativity and learning to apply a design thinnking approach.

Dotillism is a casual zen game that I created with [@seldon1000](https://github.com/seldon1000/) at the Academy, is available for free on [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/dotillism/id1611775193) and is built entirely with SwiftUI.
